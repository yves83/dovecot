For testing, you can edit the dovecot-openssl.cnf and run mkcert.sh to generate a self-signed certificate for testing. The SSL Cert will export to conf/ folder.

For production, you have to replace the ssl certificate, dovecot-cert and dovecot-key, with the production certificate.

You can update the configuration file, dovecot.conf, in conf/ folder.
